Face Recognition using Deep Learning with CNN
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize faces. A CNN is a type of deep learning algorithm that is specifically designed for image processing.

The project consists of the following files:

FINALCODEface_Recognition.ipynb - The main Python script that runs the project.
Datasets - The directory that contains the training and testing data.

How does it work?
The project works in the following steps:

The training data is loaded from the Datasets directory. The training data consists of a set of images of faces, each with a corresponding label that identifies the person in the image.
The CNN is trained on the training data. The CNN learns to identify the features that are unique to each person's face.
The testing data is loaded from the Datasets directory. The testing data consists of a set of images of faces that the CNN has not seen before.
The CNN is used to predict the labels for the testing data. The CNN's predictions are then compared to the actual labels to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
Results
The project was trained on a dataset of 900 images of faces. The dataset consisted of 10 different people, with 90 images of each person. The CNN was able to achieve an accuracy of 97% on the testing data.

Future work
There are a number of ways that this project could be improved in the future. One way would to train the CNN on a larger dataset of faces. This would help the CNN to learn more about the features that are unique to different people's faces. Another way to improve the project would to use a different CNN architecture. There are many different CNN architectures available, and some architectures may be better suited for face recognition than others.

Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:

NumPy
TensorFlow
Keras
The project also requires the following data:

A dataset of images of faces, each with a corresponding label that identifies the person in the image.
How to use
To use the project, you will need to first download the project files and the data. Then, you can run the main.py script. The script will automatically load the data and train the CNN. Once the CNN is trained, you can use it to predict the labels for new images of faces.
